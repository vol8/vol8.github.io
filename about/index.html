            <p>
            My name is "vol". You may also know me as "outside". As of writing this, I am 16 years old. I live in Germany. </br>
            I am a computer science enthusiast and amateur music producer at the same time. Having multiple hobbies, school and other responsibilities makes everything I want to do much harder. Just because I am saying a project is unfinished, for a year, doesn't mean that I forgot about it. Either I am stuck at something else or my inner light got dim.
            </br> </br>
            So... what does "vol" and "outside" specifically do?
            <h2>VOL</h2>
            Vol is the guy who does programming. I started out with learning "C" to start decomp hacking Pokemon games. So I know a lot about embedded programming (I even learned arm asm at one point, but I forgot most of it). During that time, I also started learning "Rust" which is my go to language so far. It's memory safe, has a beautiful ecosystem and allows for safe programming. No garbage collector, no weird polymorphism like in "Java" or "C++". Rust found its own way of handling OOP and it is fast :) </br>
            Other than that, there is nothing more I do. Of course I also do some web development. This page wouldn't exist if I didn't learn the basics. </br> </br>

            I am always open for new things. It doesn't matter if it's a new language, library or framework :)
            <h2>OUTSIDE</h2>
            Outside is the guy who uses his creativity to create something. I dont have a favourite genre, I just listen to what sounds best. I am an FL user but I want to try to use Ableton, since the workflow is better for producing. I haven't released anything so far. </br>
            I personally view music as art. This is the reason why focus a lot on sound design. Fuck presets. But don't get me wrong. I think it's okay to use presets, just dont over do it. Using presets makes you an artist that is easily replacable. Consider recycling samples to create new sounds. Use spectral or granular synthesis since both methods make interesting sounds. And don't release anything before you have a good feeling about it. Mix the track until you are feeling 100% sure that it sounds good. Take your time when producing. Music should be art, not something that is being mass produced.
